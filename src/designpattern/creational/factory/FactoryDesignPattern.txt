The Factory Design Pattern is one of the Creational Patterns in object-oriented programming
 that provides an interface for creating objects in a super class but allows subclasses to
  alter the type of objects that will be created. It is used when the exact type of the object
  needed isnâ€™t known until runtime, or when the creation logic is complex and should be centralized.

Key Features of the Factory Design Pattern:
Decouples Object Creation from Use: It abstracts the process of creating objects, making the code
more modular and scalable.
Encapsulates Object Creation: Object creation logic is moved to a separate factory class,
 keeping the client code clean.
Flexible Object Creation: It provides flexibility to create objects of various types depending
on the situation.
